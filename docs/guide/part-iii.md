# Part III: Implementing Higher-Order Functions with TDD

## The three rules of TDD

Robert C. Martin provides a concise set of rules for practicing Test-Driven Development. [[?]](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd)

1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

## Create test case for ‚Äúfilter‚Äù function

Create a `filter.test.ts` file in `modules` folder, and create a test case for `filter` function.

```ts
import { test, expect } from 'vitest';
import { filter } from './index';

test('filter should work', () => {
  const actual = filter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], (v: number) => v > 2);
  const expected = [3, 4, 5];

  expect(actual).toStrictEqual(expected);
});
```

Run `test` command.

```bash
npm run test

üî¥ FAIL  src/modules/filter.test.ts > filter
TypeError: filter is not a function
```

## Implement ‚Äúfilter‚Äù function

Update `index.ts` file in `modules` folder.

```ts
// ...
import filter from './filter';

export {
  // ...
  filter,
};
```

Create a `filter.ts` file in `modules` folder, and implement the `filter` function.

```ts
const filter = (items: Array<any>, callable: Function) => {
  const res = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    if (callable(items[i])) {
      res.push(items[i]);
    }
  }
  return res;
};

export default filter;
```

Run `test` command.

```bash
npm run test

üü¢ PASS  Waiting for file changes...
```

## Implement more functions

Implement more higher-order functions with TDD:

- map ‚úÖ
- filter ‚úÖ
- every
- find
- forEach
- reduce
- reject
- some

Finally, run `coverage` command.

```bash
npm run coverage
```

## Publish to NPM

Build the package before publishing.

```bash
npm run build
```

Login to NPM.

```bash
npm login
```

Update `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "name": "@username/collection-js",
  "private": false,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  // ...
}
```

Publish to NPM with dry run.

```bash
npm publish --dry-run
```

Publish to NPM.

```bash
npm publish --access=public
```
